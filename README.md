# What Do You Meme

What Do You Meme is a class project for Web Server Programming, Spring 2020 at SUNY New Paltz. We'll be working on files for the project in class and following along with them in this project. 

## Who Are You?

My name is Michael Parish. I am a Master's degree student at SUNY New Paltz. During the course of this semester in Web Server Programming, I’m hoping to build upon my existing knowledge and experience in Web Development. I feel like I only have a cursory understanding of the technologies that can be used to build more complex websites and apps, having only built simple websites with simple features in the past. I’m still not sure what direction I would like to pursue once my Master’s degree is completed, so I am also hoping to get a clearer vision of my path forward after finishing this course and this semester. I’ve always liked the idea of creating an app but I’ve never been sure where to start or how to go about it, so I hope to be able to create my own apps in the future as well!
